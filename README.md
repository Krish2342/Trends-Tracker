‚úÖ Step 2: Integrated GNews API

Fetched real-time trending news using the GNews API.

Got API Key and added it to .env.local file for security.

Example used: https://gnews.io/api/v4/top-headlines?token=YOUR_API_KEY&lang=en

‚úÖ Step 4: Learned Schema and Migration

Understood how to define database schema using .sql files or Supabase Studio.

Created migration files using Supabase CLI to track DB changes over time.

‚ö† Faced Issue: Migration Errors

While pushing migrations to Supabase, some errors came up.

Errors related to database not being accessible or schema problems.



---

üê≥ Step 5: Installed Docker Desktop

Installed Docker Desktop to run local PostgreSQL DB.

Ran database locally using Docker, which helped debug migration issues.

Example command:

docker run --name postgres-local -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=1234 -p 5432:5432 -d postgres



---

‚úÖ Step 6: Fixed Migration Errors

After setting up Docker, the schema and migration worked properly.

Now Supabase is working both locally (via Docker) and online (via Supabase dashboard).

‚úÖ Current Status

Site is successfully running.

Real-time trending data is showing.

Backend and database setup is complete.
